# HOT IRON

CLI app that:
- configures routes w/ `.html` files
- deploys go server to designated target

## STEPZ

1. Accept `.html` file path as input + copy it into `dist` folder
2. Support multiple routes -> start with `/` then ask for more
3. Write server code + build server w/ routes
4. Admin -> thinking CLI w/ redeploy (support GCP or AWS first) (requires auth but could use magic link or google oauth)
5. Payments integrations
